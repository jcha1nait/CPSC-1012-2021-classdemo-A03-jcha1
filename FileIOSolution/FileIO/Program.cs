             * Methods
             * 
             * Why?????
             *     reduce code redundancy
             *     break up your code into smaller manageable pieces
             * 
             * Where do methods go?
             *     methods go into your program class
             * 
             * Syntax for a method
             *     accesstype returndatatype MethodName ([List of parameters])
             *     {
             *     coding block
             *     }
             *     
             *     accesstype?
             *     This is dependant on what is the Main access type or if the class is NOT
             *     the entry point to your entire application, could be public, private, internal, protected,...
             *     
             *     returndatatype?
             *     Methods have been called by many names
             *     Methods have been called subroutines, functions, methods
             *     Subroutines and functions are different in that subroutines return no data
             *     to the calling statement; whereas functions will return data to the calling statement.
             *     The return datatype must be a valid language datatype
             *     The return datatype in C$ that returns nothing is the keyword void
             *     
             *     MethodName?
             *     This is what the method is called
             *     The method name is usually unique
             *     The method names that are not uniques are paired with their list of
             *     parameters to create a method signature.
             *     The method signature MUST be unique.
             *     This is referred to as overload methods.
             *     
             *     [list of parameters] (optional)
             *     What is a parameter?
             *     datatype parametername
             *     consider the parameter a variable within your method that has already been
             *     declared and can be used on other variables
             *     
             *     What is a list of parameters?
             *     datatype parametername, datatype parametername, .....
